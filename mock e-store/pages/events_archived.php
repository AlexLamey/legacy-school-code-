          <dt>Tuesday, December 7, 2021</dt>
            <dd>To get the kickstart in funding we needed to start building our farm, we 
		went to the Dayle's Grand Market to show off a few of our pieces of the 
		past, as well as sell a few of our signiture blueberries grown on site.</dd>
          <dt>Friday, December 31, 2021</dt>
            <dd>To celebrate the new year, we hosted a New Years Eve party (compliant with 
		all local COVID-19 gathering policies at the time) on our newly constructed 
		farm and museam site. There were laughs to be had, Quails to be pet, and most 
		excitingly, craft blueberry ciders made on site served. The latter was a raging 
		success, so expect to find the same drink on our e-store in the future!</dd>

          As our history continues to grow, so too will the depths of this page to better reflect 
	  and better elaborate on these events. This page will be updated as time goes on.
