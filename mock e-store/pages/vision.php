        <h3>About Amazing Stuff: Our Vision and Mission</h3>
        <p>
          The two founders have had two goals: to give back to the community that 
          raised them, and to preserve the history of their homeland. While the seeds 
          have been sown to achieve both of these, this alone cannot sate their thirst 
          for ambition.

          Inevitably, Danielle and Ashlynn intend to use their farm as a place of refuge 
          for people suffering from mental illness, domestic abuse, homelessness or even 
          anyone that needs a place to stay for the night, all at the low low price of a 
          little compassion and assistance on the farm.
